# NeoDuino

## Description
~~~~~~~
This is a demo project where am learning abt the Alitum software by designing a Arduino like board - NeoDuino
~~~~~~~

## How can I create one?

- Have a Rough but complete schematic of the complete Ckt diagram, it should be complete and descriptive abt the 
  components used
- Start by creating schematic symbols of all the components present in the diagram -- you will need to create a 
  schematic library of your own which will contain all the required components needed in desiging the board
- Create footprint for all the components as they will be used in PCB designing, create/add 3D model of the 
  component add integrate it with the footprint if u want a 3D design of the board
- Add the footprints to the corresponding components schematic diagram
